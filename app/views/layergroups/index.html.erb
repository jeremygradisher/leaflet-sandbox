<h1>Laye Groups and Layers Control</h1>
<p>Find me: <a href="http://leafletjs.com/examples/layers-control.html" target="_blank">http://leafletjs.com/examples/layers-control.html</a></p>


<p>
	This tutorial will show you how to group several layers into one, and how to use the layers control 
	to allow users to easily switch different layers on your map.
</p>

	<!-- Create map div - of course you need the height!!!! -->
	<div id="map" style="height: 400px"></div>


	<script>
	//Let’s suppose you have a bunch of layers you want to combine into a group to handle them as one in your code - 
	//Instead of adding them directly to the map, you can do the following, using the LayerGroup class:
		var cities = new L.LayerGroup();

		L.marker([39.61, -105.02]).bindPopup('This is Littleton, CO.').addTo(cities),
		L.marker([39.74, -104.99]).bindPopup('This is Denver, CO.').addTo(cities),
		L.marker([39.73, -104.8]).bindPopup('This is Aurora, CO.').addTo(cities),
		L.marker([39.77, -105.23]).bindPopup('This is Golden, CO.').addTo(cities);

		//There are two types of layers — base layers that are mutually exclusive (only one can be visible on your map), 
		//e.g. tile layers, and overlays — all the other stuff you put over the base layers. In this example, we want to 
		//have two base layers (grayscale and night-style base map) to switch between, and an overlay to switch on and off 
		//— city markers (those we created earlier). Let’s create those layers and add the default ones to the map:
	    var grayscale   = L.tileLayer(mbUrl, {id: 'mapbox.light', attribution: mbAttr}),
		    streets  = L.tileLayer(mbUrl, {id: 'mapbox.streets',   attribution: mbAttr});

		var map = L.map('map', {
			center: [39.73, -104.99],
			zoom: 10,
			layers: [grayscale, cities]
		});

		//here we are creating the baseLayers
		var baseLayers = {
			"Grayscale": grayscale,
			"Streets": streets
		};

		//here we are creating the overlays
		var overlays = {
			"Cities": cities
		};

		//create a Layers Control and add it to the map
		//The first argument passed when creating the layers control is the base layers object. 
		//The second argument is the overlays object. Both arguments are optional — for example, 
		//you can pass just a base layers object by omitting the second argument, or just an overlays 
		//objects by passing null as the first argument.
		L.control.layers(baseLayers, overlays).addTo(map);
